#' Species turnover
#'
#' Calculate rates of species' gains and losses
#'
#' DOCUMENTATION NOT DONE
#' The function calculates the number of individuals in a group of 
#' species that are gained or lost per timestep. The function takes 
#' a turnover matrix, returned by \code{\link{run_sim}} when
#' code{calc_rates=TRUE} and then calculates the number of individuals
#' of each species that are gained or lost per timestep, summing across
#' cells in each spatial unit in \code{locs}. A parameter \code{agg_times}
#' can be used to aggregate timepoints prior to calculating rates. 
#' This aggregation is relative to the timepoints stored in the turnover
#' array and not to the actual timesteps in the simulation. 
#' For example, specifying \code{agg_times=10} on a turnover matrix containing
#' every other timestep will aggregate individuals from \code{T=1:20,
#' T=21:40,...} and then divide each by 20 timesteps to calculate the rates.
#' Once individual species rates have been calculated, the function sums
#' rates across species groups (\code{which_species}), given as a vector 
#' that can be interpreted as a factor identifying which species 
#' belong to which groups. If the user wishes to calculate
#' average rates within groups they will need to divide the results by
#' the number of species in each group. By default species are not grouped and 
#' rates for individual species are returned. 
#' 
#' @param turnover (required) an array of species rates of turnover, as
#' 	returned by \code{run_sim} when \code{calc_rates=TRUE}. Should have
#' dimensions \code{[time, row, column, species, gain/loss rate]}.
#' @param locs (required) either a two-column matrix of cell locations where 
#' 	species' rates should be summed or a list of matrices designating
#' 	multiple spatial units where rates should be summed (see details)
#' @param t_window (required) either a list containing \code{start}
#' 	and \code{stop} specifying that all collected timepoints in that interval
#' 	should be considered or an explicit vector of timepoints 
#' @param agg_times either a single number specifing the number of timepoints 
#' 	that should be aggregated before calculating rates or a list of
#' 	vectors defining exactly which timepoints should be aggregated (see details).
#' 	Defaults to no aggregation.
#' @param which_species a vector of integers indicating which species should be
#' 	grouped and averaged. Defaults to each species analyzed separately.
#' @return a array of rates of species gains and losses in each location at 
#' 	each timepoint (dimensions \code{[temporal unit, spatial unit, 
#' 	gain or loss, species group]}).
