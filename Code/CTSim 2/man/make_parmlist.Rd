\arguments{

\value{
a named list
}
\description{
Creates a list of parameters to used in a simulation from objects present
in a given environment.
}
\details{
The function searches the current environment (or one given in 
\code{e}) for a set of required and optional parameters used by
\code{\link{run_sim}} to run a simulation. Parameters are saved in 
a named list which can be used in the \code{parms} argument of
\code{\link{run_sim_N}} or written to a file using \code{\link{write_parms}}.
The following parameters are \strong{required} for simulation and \emph{must be present
in the environment or the function will fail}:
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{dimX}} : x-dimension of landscape
\item \strong{\code{dimY}} : y-dimension of landscape
\item \strong{\code{S_A}} : number of specialist species on habitat type A
\item \strong{\code{S_B}} : number of specialist species on habitat type B
\item \strong{\code{m_rates}} : vector of mortality rates on preferred and 
	non-preferred habitats
\item \strong{\code{r_rates}} : vector of recruitment rates on preferred 
	and non-preferred habitats
\item \strong{\code{K}} : carrying capacity of cells. 
\item \strong{\code{nsteps}} : number of timesteps to simulate
\item \strong{\code{nruns}} : number of independent simulations to run
}
For further details on \code{S_A}, \code{S_B}, \code{m_rates} and 
\code{r_rates} see \code{\link{make_species}}. For further details on 
\code{K} see \code{\link{populate_landscape}}.

The following parameters are optional and more information can 
be found in the documentation on the functions they are passed to:
\itemize{
\item Parameters passed to \code{\link{make_landscape}}
	\itemize{
		\item \strong{\code{vgm_dcorr}} : distance at which habitat values become
			uncorrelated
		\item \strong{\code{vgm_mod}} : variogram model controling spatial 
			autocorrelation of habitat values
		\item \strong{\code{habA_prop}} : proportion of landscape that comprised of
			habitat type A
	}
\item Parameters passed to \code{\link{make_species}}
	\itemize{
		\item \strong{\code{S_AB}} : number of generalist species
		\item \strong{\code{dist_b}} : list defining the distribution from which 
			species' birth rates are sampled
		\item \strong{\code{dist_d}} : list defining the distribution from which
			species' dispersal rates are sampled. Must contain character string
			named \code{type}.
		\item \strong{\code{dist_v}} : list defining the distribution from which
			species' movement rates are sampled. Must contain character string
			named \code{type}.
		\item \strong{\code{dist_gsad}} : list defining distribution from which
			global species abundances are sampled or 'b_rates', indicating 
			that the gsad should match species birth rates in their preferred 
			habitat.
	}
\item Parameters passed to \code{\link{populate_landscape}}
	\itemize{
		\item \strong{\code{prop_full}} : proportion of the landscape's carrying
			capacity that should initially contain individuals
		\item \strong{\code{init_distribute}} : character string indicating how
			individuals should be initially distributed across the landscape
		\item \strong{\code{cells_distribute}} : if \code{init_distribute} is 
			is 'designated', a matrix giving the locations of cells in which
			to place propagule
	}
\item Parameters passed to \code{\link{run_sim}}
	\itemize{
		\item \strong{\code{d_kernel}} : list defining the shape of the dispersal
			kernel of new propagules.
		\item \strong{\code{v_kernel}} : list defining the shape of the movement
			kernel of established individuals
		\item \strong{\code{imm_rate}} : immigration rate- probability than an 
			empty space will be colonized by a migrant from outside
			the metacommunity
		\item \strong{\code{calc_rates}} : logical indicating whether rates of
			species turnover should be calculated
	}
\item Parameters passed to \code{\link{run_sim_N}}
	\itemize{
		\item \strong{\code{save_steps}} : vector of timesteps to save in each 
			simulation
		\item \strong{\code{simID}} : character string that identifies simulations
			run on this set of parameters
	}
}
}
\note{
Developers should note that this function must be manually  
updated whenever new parameters are added to simulation functions.
