Package: CTSim
Title: Spatially Explicit Simulation of Core-Transient Metacommunity Dynamics
Version: 0.1.7
Authors@R: person("Jessica", "Coyle", , "jes.r.coyle@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: CTSim contains functions for executing a simulation of a
    metacommunity on a grid of habitat types. The simulation models a species
    pool of habitat specialists and generalists as they stochastically colonize
    and disperse across the landscape.
